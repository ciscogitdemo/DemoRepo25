How to use bullet points

* Make sure all items in the list are related to each other
* Use the same font and margin width in each bulleted point
* Keep bullet points short, preferably no more than three lines long
* Begin all items with the same part of speech (active verbs work well) and make sure they are in parallel form
* Make all bullet points approximately the same length
* Make sure the format is consistent within each list
* Emphasize the beginning of each bullet point to make the list skim-friendly
* Use periods at the end of each line only if they are complete sentences
